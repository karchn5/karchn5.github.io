        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h3>I am currently designing and developing a website for my family's business,<br>Sweet O Donuts.</h3>
        <p>I am creating a temporary website as a placeholder, but will be updating the design and further developing the website as a project for COGS 121. I am in the user research phase of the process. I have created a survey and will be gathering insight from potential customers regarding their experiences with small business websites.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to participate, please fill out the survery <a href="#">here</a>! Thank you!</p>
        <h2>Temporary Design</h2>
        <p>This is the temporary design of the website. I have mostly developed the homepage. I will be working on developing the menu page for the different products offered and debugging features.</p>

            <h4>A small donut shop business website.</h4>
            <p><b>Role:</b> UI/UX Designer, Web Designer, Web Developer</p>
            <p><b>Tools:</b> Figma, HTML/CSS/Javascript</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p> Sweet O Donuts is a family-run donut shop in Huntington Beach, California. I have designed and developed a website for their business with the goal of providing easy access to information that customers are curious about, while offering a way to find and purchase products they may be interested in.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="casestudy-section">
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Prior to visiting a business, customers will check the business website for information they need such as the location or menu. When the information is not straightforward or non-existent, it may frustrate the customer and dissuade them from utilizing the business they’ve searched for. Customers need a way to quickly find relevant information about a business in order to ensure a frustration free experience and encourage more purchases.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="casestudy-section">
            <h2>Needfinding</h2>
            <p>In a survey I conducted online, I asked participants when and how/often they visit a food business website, what they search for/expect to find, what aspects of the website’s performance is most important, and to describe experiences that improved or negatively impacted their user experience while on a website. I also revealed a pre-design I made based on what I believed a customer would desire and asked for critiques.

            <p>Results: Most users check the website of a business prior to their first visit. When visiting the website, the features most expected to be found are the menu, business hours, and customer reviews. Users prefer websites that are fast, mobile friendly, concise, and easy to navigate. The most helpful features users find on other sites are menus with pictures and prices and easy navigation. Users are frustrated when pictures are inaccurate, prices aren’t shown, information is irrelevant, or the site is too complicated.</p>

            <h2>Prototyping</h2>
            <p>We created prototypes to make our ideas physical and visualize interactions made within the apps. The first prototype was an idea proposed with the above storyboard that ultimately became fraise. The second was an french-teaching conversation bot app, but it was out of our scope and decided on the first. We wanted to keep the interface clean and easy to click through. </p>

            </div>
            <p>With peer feedback, we improved the structure to be more clearly laid out and changed the topic names to better represent their content. Users weren't sure how to use the app in some cases so we decided to add a help button on ambiguous pages along with a more hierarchical design.</p>

            <p>Utilizing a survey format, I introduced two figma prototypes for the order feature to participants and asked them to navigate through them as if they were ordering some donuts. After each prototype, I asked if they enjoyed or disliked any specific features. I then asked participants to compare the two designs and choose which was preferrable based on each of <b>Nielsen’s Heuristics.</b> This allowed me to receive feedback on the <b>advantages and disadvantages of each prototype</b> and to consolidate those suggestions into one.</p>
            
                <!-- Some disadvantages according to the heuristics were:
            <ol>
                <li><b><i>Consistency and Standards heuristic</i></b> -  the navigation buttons in our prototype were inconsistent in size and location</li>
                <li><b><i>Help and Documentation heuristic</i></b> - users misinterpreted tasks due to lack of apparent steps or explanation</li>
                <li><b><i>Match between System and Real World heuristic</i></b> - some category names on the lessons screen weren't relevant enough to its content</li>

            <div class="center-text"><img class="casestudy-img" src="images/fraise/actualmock.png"></div>
            <p>We cut out a few features that we weren't able to complete functionality for in the final. This included the ability to switch out phrases with automatic translation, ability to create new categories for favorited words, and a leveling system. Due of lack of capability and time, we decided to focus on our features of practices, quizzes, and favoriting. Achievements are earned when using these features and can be compared to friends'.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Throughout the process of creating this app, I realized <b>how important user testing was for adjusting the flow of the app and meeting the needs of an actual user</b>. I also have realized a growing passion for front-end development. Being the appointed designer, it was my job to provide the app with pleasing aesthetics and an easy to navigate layout. However, I wanted to go beyond just designing and help with the actual creation of the app itself. I was able to apply my designs through HTML/CSS. Although my skills are currently limited in that realm, <b>I've decided to invest more into learning front-end development so I can better create what I design.</b></p>
