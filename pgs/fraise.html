                            In a team of three, fraise was created to offer users an interactive way to learn phrases in French while sharing progress with friends.

Some disadvantages according to the heuristics were:
                        </p><br>
                        <ol class="casestudy__text">

                            <li><b><i>Help and Documentation heuristic</i></b> - users misinterpreted tasks due to lack of apparent steps or explanation</li>
                            <li><b><i>Match between System and Real World heuristic</i></b> - some category names on the lessons screen weren't relevant enough to its content</li>

                        <p class="casestudy__text">With the feedback, we improved the structure to be more clearly laid out and changed the topic names to better represent their content.

                        <p class="casestudy__text">	Once these features were integrated into a single app idea and developed into a working prototype, we performed another testing session with 3 new users. The users were able to actually <b>navigate and interact with the app’s features while explaining their process</b>. They helped point out issues using Neilson’s Heuristics, expressing their frustrations with confusing wording or button placements. We used this feedback to further improve the app’s layout according to <b>user’s needs and expectations:</b>.</p>

                            <li>We decided to alleviate confusion of tasks by adjusting the user flow so the practice can lead to quizzes then to the profile page to show achievements.</li>

                        <p class="casestudy__text">As we finalized the app’s design and functions, we utilized A/B testing to help us decide on layout features. We had two versions of the profile page randomly generated and <b>used google analytics to track the frequency of clicks</b> in both versions. We decided to test whether having tabs or a one page layout be more user friendly. We hypothesized that, in the layout with two tabs (Version A), the user is less likely to navigate to the friends tab and utilize the 'Add Friend' feature, whereas in the layout without tabs (Version B), the user is more likely to use the 'Add Friend' feature because the button is immediately visible.

                        <p class="casestudy__text">This testing session revealed that there was no statistical difference, however this may be due to the lack of data and would need more time to create a complete conclusion. Since users might miss the second tab, we decided to implement the one-page version for the final project.</p>

However, I wanted to go beyond just designing and help with the actual creation of the app itself. I was able to apply my designs through HTML/CSS. Although my skills are currently limited in that realm, <b>I've decided to invest more into learning front-end development so I can better create what I design.</b></p>
