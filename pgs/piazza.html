Although this application is widely used by college instructors and students, its usability issues make users hesitant to fully use its features. The current mobile version contains components that make using it as a discussion forum difficult. We wanted to redesign the Piazza mobile application such that it is easy to navigate and efficiently perform the actions that users desire.

                            <p class="casestudy__text">We recruited four college student participants for this user testing phase. As the main demographic of Piazza, these participants helped identify the breakdowns that different users can come across while using the mobile application.</p>

                            <p class="casestudy__text">We asked each user to perform the main tasks that Piazza is used for and had them think aloud for us to understand their thought process for each action taken. After this testing, we identified the main three usability errors for all participants:</p>

                                <li>Piazza utilizes the same design for different features which makes it difficult for users to understand their functions before use

                                <li>All users were confused with the Piazza wording at some point in their testing - Wording is ambiguous and difficult to differentiate

                                <li>Piazza consistently utilizes the ellipsis as an indication of ‘more’ features but the features included are not obvious to the user, it isn’t labeled to aid understanding

                            <p class="casestudy__text">The single component that would have the greatest effect on the issues described previously was decided to be the ellipsis icon that is present on most screens of the application.

                            <p class="casestudy__text mgtop-med">We compiled the difficulties with the ellipsis icon that all users struggles with during user testing to aid our redesign of the component:</p>

                            <p class="casestudy__text">Upon being asked to follow a post, two participants did not choose the ellipsis button and instead clicked the star which allows a user to favorite the post.

                            <br>
                            <p class="casestudy__text"><b class = "emphasize">2) Uses the ellipsis icon as the last option</b><br>One participant repeatedly used the ellipsis for features that they couldn’t find on the main screens as the backup option. The ellipsis icon changes functionality on each page and acts as a general location for extra features. These features aren’t clearly indicated to be accessible by this icon and leaves the user to guess what it does.
                            </p>

                            <p class="casestudy__text">Our final recommendations would be to add a <b>bottom navigation bar that is consistent all throughout the application.</b> By doing so, users will have a reliable system to find or return to their desired page. In addition to a bottom navigation bar, there should also be an <b>implementation of more intuitive icons</b> that allow the user to immediately recognize the function of the icon. These icons should also have distinct labels to prevent any ambiguity. A filter dropdown is also recommended on the course posts page to help the user identify the usable filters and effectively sort their posts.</p>

This project cemented my belief in the signifance of having a thourough plan at the beginning of the process. <b>I am very proud of our team's efficiency and am excited for another opportunity in the future to push pass the limitations presented to me!</b></p>
