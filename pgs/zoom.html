                        <p class="casestudy__text">I interviewed three participants, <b>two middle school students and one college student.</b> Although I was not focused on Zoom at this point, all interviewees happened to utilize Zoom as their primary application. I asked them to describe their typical day with remote learning, which features of the app they use, what they like and dislike about the tool, how remote learning compares to regular school and what might improve their experience.</p>
                        <p class="casestudy__text"><br>From my interviews, I identified two major concerns of students while participating during online class and communicating with other students and teachers:

                        <br><br><b>Students want more ways to participate during class so that it can become more engaging.</b> It is quite difficult to focus on class when there are so many distractions on both the computer and the home environment. Having more methods to react, comment, or indicate the desire to participate could give students more action options rather than just staring at the computer screen during class.
                            
                        <br><br><b>Students want a way to effectively communicate their work and ideas in a way that would allow correction and feedback from others.</b> For younger students, most of their work is done on paper and requires written work and answers. There is currently feature on Zoom that allows the students to share this work other than holding it up to a screen.

                        <p class="casestudy__text"><br>Focusing on the call windows for all applications, I reviewed several different video meeting applications to identify features that benefit classroom meetings. Of the features I selected to compare, Zoom currently doesn’t offer features for taking screenshotsor a pinning messages. (Although Microsoft teams currently doesn't have pinned messages, their development team stated that this feature will soon be released based on user feedback.) I believed these additions could <b>help students receive and retain important information during their classes.</b> 

                        <br><br>Although Zoom has a feature to upload files, it is limited to only uploading files directly from the computer.

This feature benefits students who prefer speaking when called upon. I hoped to improve the placement of features so students may efficiently participate in their classes in their preferred way.

                            <p class="casestudy__text"><br><b>2)</b> This user flow is focused on the ability to <b>share offline work with the teacher and classmates.</b> Although students can hold up their papers to the screen, it is difficult to see and cannot be saved onto the screen. I decided to consider a feature that allows students to take pictures on their phones and upload it during a meeting. This addition could make sharing work easier and allow a more accurate presentation. I also hoped to add the option for students to annotate their work before sharing it to indicate the section that needs help.

                            <p class="casestudy__text"><br><b>3)</b> This user flow is focused on <b>saving information during a meeting.</b> Currently on Zoom, there is no way of retaining the information directly from zoom besides recording and saving the entire chat. Due to lengthy recordings or lack of recordings from some teachers, students cannot find vital information. The addition of a screenshot feature would allow students to save key information that is shown on screens. Information is also lost in the chat because there is no method of separating messages from each other. Allowing teachers to pin or students to save messages such as links or supplemental content could help students find and retain information when needed.

                            <p class="casestudy__text mgbtm-med">Initially I created one version of UI sketches for each user flow. I narrowed these sketches to three main features I hoped to implement or improve: participation button, uploading files, and pinning messages.

                            <p class="casestudy__text"> <br><b>For pinning messages</b>, I considered how pinned messages will be displayed and accessed. I wanted these messages to either be displayed at the top of the chat box, or have a separate section for all pinned messages to be. I thought locating these messages at the top would be most obvious and beneficial for students to see. Looking between tabs might not be an efficient method.

                                <b>For uploading photos</b>, I wanted to implement a feature to either add your files onto zoom for easy access during meetings or the ability to take a picture from your phone to upload during meetings. Files are able to be uploaded onto Zoom from either your computer or phone and be shown during meetings. If this feature seems out of reach, I want to at least allow students to take a picture of their work with their phones and upload onto zoom to be shared with the class.

                            <p class="casestudy__text"><br>
                                The <b>pinned message feature</b> is basically the same from the ui sketch, except there is a pin icon next to the pinned massage. Clicking this again will remove the message from the pinned list.

                                For the <b>photo upload feature</b>, I reconsidered the current design for uploading files and added my feature to match. The file button will remain the same, but there is an option to upload from the computer or from the phone. Choosing the phone method is the main functionality of my additional feature. The user will be notified on their phone to upload a picture and it will transfer to their computer zoom application. Each option presented to the user is placed based on which function will be used most. I decided not to continue with the screenshot or the saved message functions because there are other options to do so.

                        <p class="casestudy__text">I tested my prototype on three college students. Although this is not my target audience, their experience with zoom is still valuable to improving the application. I was able to safely perform user testing in person which helped me better understand their actions and choices while they interacted with my prototype.<br>

                        <br>
                            I asked all participants to complete a task based on each feature / user flow:<br>
                                        <br><b>1) Raise your hand to indicate your desire to participate.</b> <br>
                                        A participant tried to remove the hand by re-clicking the raise hand button instead of the x next to the hand indication. This was because that is how the feature currently works on zoom. <b>I needed to integrate Zoom's previous design with my new design for users to easily transition and have multiple options</b> to perform the tasks they need.<br>

                                        <br>   <b>2) Pin a message.</b><br>
                                        A participant expected a confirmation when clicking to remove the pinned message. <b>I needed to ensure that the actions that users take are obvious so that they can have confidence</b> when taking those actions.<br>  

                                        <br>   <b>3) Upload an image from your phone. </b><br>
                                        One participant was concerned that uploading a picture from the phone isn’t useful. He suggests that he would instead email himself the photo then upload it from his computer. However, another participant appreciated the uploading idea because the students she tutors struggle to share their work with her. This feature would be very helpful to have in her case. 
                                        The first participant was confused when trying to use the uploading a photo from his phone prototype. The app didn’t tell him that a link was sent to his phone after he clicked ‘upload from phone’, it also didn’t tell him when the photo was sent to his computer. <b>I needed the feature to be efficient so that it can be useful rather than a hassle. I also needed to confirm the user's actions after each step to decrease risk of confusion.</b>

                        I presented my high fidelity prototype and its features to three participants: a roommate and two classmates. I asked them to rate the usability of each feature and what aspects could use improvement. 
                        <br><br>The participation button and pinning messages features were rated with high ease of use and understanding, but the photo upload was less intuitive and received mixed ratings. A participant expressed concerns that the feature might be "confusing when split into 2 devices." Users might be unfamiliar with cross-device features and be hesitant to use it. <b>The feature needs to clearly guide the user through its functions and provide several confirmations to avoid this confusion.</b>
                        <br><br>
                        I showed my participants two alternative screens from the original design and asked them to state their preferrence and why:

                        All three participants chose the same screens as their preference. For the <b>mobile photo upload screens</b>, the alternative screen that shows the picture in full view was chosen and commented to be “more intuitive and familiar.” For <b>the file send in chat screen</b>, the original screen with the file inserted into the text form of the messaging section was the preferred since it simply "makes sense." Having the file within the text form helps the user understand that it can be sent with a message.

                        <br><br>    
                        I didn’t edit much of the raise hand or pinned messages screens besides altering the sizes of buttons and adding a realistic meeting screen to make the prototype feel more real. 
                        I used the selection of the alternative screen to redesign other screens of the photo upload feature. I used the same transparency to feature more of the photo that is taken for each step of the process. I matched the ‘upload’ button on the bottom right of the upload screen to the ‘done’ button on the edit screen so it may be easier for the user to reach the next step.

                        The main objective of this project was to enhance the learning experience for K-12 students while learning remotely. Through user research, I was able to identify the two main struggles for students using Zoom: participation and sharing their work. Focusing on these issues, <b>I redesigned how students would be able to indicate their desire to participate through the interaction button and how they would be able to share their offline work during meetings by uploading photos with their phones.</b>
                        <br><br>
                        This project revealed to me just how important it is to <b>keep both your objective and user needs in mind throughout the entire design process.</b> I am often excited by new ideas and want to race ahead to creation, but returning to earlier steps of the process and reviewing the results of user research is paramount to staying focused.
