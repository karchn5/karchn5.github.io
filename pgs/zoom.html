                        While learning remotely, younger <b>K-12 students need a way to stay engaged with class content and communicate efficiently with their teachers and classmates</b> in order to better receive the quality of feedback and education (needed to move forward academically).

                        <p class="casestudy__text">
                            Younger K-12 students are at a great disadvantage when learning remotely because they must use new technology they might not understand yet and will not receive the hands-on experience that they need. These students may struggle with the limitations of collaborating online. They’re unable to communicate their ideas or frustrations as effectively as they could in person. Many students won’t have their parents to help them directly when they’re stuck on a problem or have a hard time understanding class content. Due to these issues, students will not receive the quality of education needed for them to prepare for future classes as they may fall behind in many ways.
                            <br> <br>My parents have witnessed these issues with my younger siblings (elementary and middle school) and have expressed their worries to me. From concerns about my younger siblings’ ability to academically progress during the Covid-19 pandemic, <b>I have chosen to redesign Zoom in hopes of developing features that could improve the remote learning experience for similar students. I would like to enhance their ability to use technology and learn efficiently while separated from their teachers and classmates.</b>

                        <p class="casestudy__text">Through user research I wanted to discover the main application tools that young students are using for their remote learning and the most significant issue that is arising while using those applications. I used two research methods: a survey and interviews.

                        <p class="casestudy__text">I conducted a survey to discover the online tools students are using for remote learning, their pain points about those tools, and what they believe the tools are missing or could have. This survey was shared online and requested responses from teachers, parents, and older siblings about their students’ experiences with remote learning. However, responses were accepted from anyone which resulted in a majority of responses from college students.</p>

                        <p class="casestudy__text">I interviewed three participants, two middle school students and one college student. Although I was not focused on Zoom at this point, all interviewees coincidently utilized Zoom as their primary application. I asked them to describe their typical day with remote learning, which features of the app they use, what they like and dislike about the tool, how remote learning compares to regular school and what might improve their experience.</p>
                        <p class="casestudy__text"><br>From my interviews, I was able to identify major concerns of students while participating during online class and communicating with other students and teachers:

                        <br><br><b>Students want more ways to participate during class so that it can become more engaging.</b> It is quite difficult to focus on class when there are so many distractions on both the computer and the home environment. Having more methods to react, comment, or indicate the desire to participate could give students more action options rather than just staring at the computer screen during class.
                            
                        <br><br><b>Students want a way to effectively communicate their work and ideas in a way that would allow correction and feedback from others.</b> For younger students, most of their work is done on paper and requires written work and answers. There is currently no method of zoom that allows the students to share this work other than holding it up to a screen.

                        <p class="casestudy__text"><br>Focusing on the call windows for all applications, I reviewed several different video meeting applications to identify features that benefit classroom meetings. Of the features I selected to compare, Zoom doesn’t currently offer a screenshot option or a feature to pin messages. (Although Microsoft teams don't currently have pinned messages, their development team stated that this feature will soon be released based on user feedback.) I believe these additions could help students receive and retain important information during their classes. 

                        <br><br>Although Zoom has a feature to upload files, it is limited to only files directly from the computer. I think options to upload from google drive or other devices as Microsoft Teams has integrated could help students share their work more efficiently.

                            <p class="casestudy__text"><br>1) This user flow is focused on the ability to communicate with the class. Although there is already a raise hand function on zoom, it is difficult to find and therefore isn’t used as often. This feature benefits students who prefer speaking when called upon. I would like to improve the placement of features so students may efficiently participate in their classes in their preferred way.
                            </p>
                            <p class="casestudy__text"><br>2) This user flow is focused on the ability to share offline work with the teacher and classmates. Although students can hold up their papers to the screen, it is difficult to see and cannot be saved onto the screen. I am considering a feature that allows students to take pictures on their phones and upload it during a meeting. This addition could make sharing work easier and allow a more accurate presentation. I also would like to add the option for students to annotate their work before sharing it to indicate the section that needs help.
                            </p>
                            <p class="casestudy__text"><br>3) This user flow is focused on saving information during a meeting. Currently on Zoom, there is no way of retaining the information directly from zoom besides recording and saving the entire chat. Due to lengthy recordings or lack of recordings from some teachers, students cannot find vital information. The addition of a screenshot feature would allow students to save key information that is shown on screens. Information is also lost in the chat because there is no method of separating messages from each other. Allowing teachers to pin or students to save messages such as links or supplemental content could help students find and retain information when needed.

                            <p class="casestudy__text mgbtm-med">Initially I created one version of UI sketches for each user flow. I narrowed these sketches to three main features I would like to implement or improve: participation button, uploading files, and pinning messages.

                            <p class="casestudy__text"> <br><b>For pinning messages</b>, I am considering how pinned messages will be displayed and accessed. I want these messages to either be displayed at the top of the chat box, or have a separate section for all pinned messages to be. I think locating these messages at the top would be most obvious and beneficial for students to see. Looking between tabs might not be efficient.

                                <b>For uploading photos</b>, I want to implement a feature to either add your files onto zoom for easy access during meetings or the ability to take a picture from your phone to upload during meetings. Files are able to be uploaded onto Zoom from either your computer or phone and be shown during meetings. If this feature seems out of reach, I want to at least allow students to take a picture of their work with their phones and upload onto zoom to be shared with the class.

                        <p class="casestudy__text">My low-fidelity prototype was designed based on the previous user flows. This prototype will allow users to use the raise hand function, pin messages, and send photos from their phones. The basic layout of the prototype differs only slightly from the original ui sketches, but the functionality of each feature is more thought out.

                            Instead of text indicating that the user is raising their hand, there is a hand icon on the top left corner. The user is able to ‘put their hand down’ by clicking the x by the raised hand. 
                            
                        </p>

                            The pinned message feature is basically the same from the ui sketch, except there is a pin icon next to the pinned massage. Clicking this again will remove the message from the pinned list.

                            For the file upload, I reconsidered the current design for uploading files and added my feature to match. The file button will remain the same, but there is an option to upload from the computer or from the phone. Choosing the phone method is the main functionality of my additional feature. The user will be notified on their phone to upload a picture and it will transfer to their computer zoom application. Each option presented to the user is placed based on which function will be used most. I decided not to continue with the screenshot or the saved message functions because there are other options to do so.

                        <p class="casestudy__text">I tested my prototype on three other college students. Although this is not my target audience, their experience with zoom is still valuable to improving the application. I mainly chose these participants because we were quarantining together and I believe testing in person is more effective. This helped me better understand their actions and choices while they interacted with my prototype.
                        <br><br>
                            I asked all participants to complete a task based on each feature / user flow:
                                        <br>   1) Raise your hand to indicate your desire to participate.
                                        <br>   2) Pin a message.
                                        <br>   3) Upload an image from your phone.
                        <br><br>   
                                All participants thought that the new features were intuitive and easily understood. Two participants expressed that they would use the new features if they actually existed on zoom. One participant was concerned that uploading a picture from the phone isn’t useful. He suggests that he would instead email himself the photo then upload it from his computer. However, another participant appreciated the uploading idea because the students she tutors struggle to share their work with her. This feature would be very helpful to have in her case. 
                                The first participant was confused when trying to use the uploading a photo from his phone prototype. The app didn’t tell him that a link was sent to his phone after he clicked ‘upload from phone’, it also didn’t tell him when the photo was sent to his computer. This participant also expected a confirmation when clicking to remove the pinned message. The last participant tried to remove the hand by re-clicking the raise hand button instead of the x next to the hand indication. This was because that is how the feature currently works on zoom.

                        <p class="casestudy__text"><br>Changes made from the low-fidelity prototype to the high-fidelity prototype were not drastic, but have increased understanding and efficiency for the features introduced. I took into consideration the need for confirmation while features are being used. I want to make it obvious when features are currently active so users don’t think otherwise. The changes are listed above with the screens shown. I decided to continue with all three features since the raising hand and pinned message features are simple but also show promise. I am most concerned about the uploading from phone features and am wondering if it is possible to implement or if it is too complicated to be realistic.

                    <p class="casestudy__text">
                        I presented my high fidelity prototype and its features to three participants: a roommate and two classmates. I asked them to rate the usability of each feature and what aspects could use improvement. The hand raising and pinning messages features were rated with high ease of use and understanding, but the uploading of a picture was less intuitive and received mixed ratings. I believe this issue is because this feature isn’t very common in other applications and it is difficult to show how the feature would work across two devices on just one screen.

                        <br><br>
                            After showing the alternative screens, all participants chose the same screens as their preference. For the picture upload, the alternative screen that shows the picture in full view was chosen and commented to be “more intuitive and familiar.” For the file send in chat screen, the original screen with the file inserted into the text form of the messaging section was the preferred. Having the file within the text form helps the user understand that it can be sent with a message. The red button to remove might introduce too many colors and confuse the user. 

                        <br><br>    
                        I didn’t edit much of the raise hand or pinned messages screens besides altering the sizes of buttons and adding a realistic meeting screen to make the prototype feel more real. 
                        I used the selection of the alternative screen to redesign other screens of the photo upload feature. I used the same transparency to feature more of the photo that is taken for each step of the process. I matched the ‘upload’ button on the bottom right of the upload screen to the ‘done’ button on the edit screen so it may be easier for the user to reach the next step.

                        <br>As I redesigned the mobile upload screens, I wanted to focus on guiding the user with action buttons. I received feedback to add contrast to action buttons so I decided to recolor them the main blue of Zoom. I also relocated the ‘take picture’ to the top of the buttons and both the ‘upload’ and ‘done’ buttons to the bottom right. This will help indicate the ‘next step’ of the process for the user. I also redesigned these screens with other photo upload messaging applications such as facebook messenger for them to appear more familiar and intuitive.
