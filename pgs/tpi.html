TPI’s values and credibility got lost in the website’s sizeable broken functionalities and distracting visual components.Unfortunately, the overall user experience did not give users a peace of mind that their engagement and donations would be used well, despite the client’s best intentions.

                            Pressed for time, we reached out to a UX Designer from Mastercard to critique and evaluate our designs. We focused on the homepage and donation pages for usability, visual understanding, and general design elements. These are the main takeaways for our next iteration:

                            During this project, I had a wonderful experience working alongside a motivated team composed of a project manager (Wesley Cho), developers (Zach Mumbauer and Amalia Riegelhuth), and fellow designer (Vickie Zhang)! 
                            <br><br>As I prepared designs for developer use, I was reminded of the importance of component based designs and having a completed design system as guidance. Working with my first client taught me the need to identify the minimum viable product (MVP) as soon as possible - especially with a strict / short timeline. Although we were all eager to implement new features and provide as many page designs as requested, doing so led us to sacrifice time that could have been used to further improve the key pages of the website.

                            With only 10 weeks to complete this project, we left the client with several additional designs and features that can be considered for future updates.
