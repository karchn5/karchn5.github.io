	<h2>Hi I'm Kara!</h2>
		<p>I am a Cognitive Science student specializing in Design and Interaction at UC San Diego. My current career interest is web design and development.</p>
		<p>I am passionate about ideas. I think ideas are the tools necessary to bring about good in the world. To share what one finds meaningful helps others cultivate on that belief and turn it into reality. I enjoy reading books and listening to talks to become absorbed into the ideas of others while creating my own. I hope to develop skills capable of communicating ideas between myself and others so beneficial changes may take place.</p>
