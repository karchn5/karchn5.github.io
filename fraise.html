    <h3>Fraise is a French language learning app that allows you to customize the phrases you learn and earn achievements with your friends.</h3>


    <h2>Defining the Problem</h2>
    <p>People often struggle to learn a new language due to the overwhelming amount of information provided in textbooks and other language apps. There aren’t many ways to customize this process and be able to choose which topics to learn and communicate with others with. People trying to learn a language need a way to personalize content desired to engage in conversation about.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>We created fraise: an app that provides the user with a set of categories of phrases to practice and take quizzes on. These phrases can be customized by switching out words to be relevant to what you’d like to talk about and favorited into personal categories. Through quizzes, you’re able to earn achievements and can compare with your friends.</p>

    <h2>Storyboarding</h2>
    <img src="images/fraise/storyboard.png">
    <p>We created storyboards to explore possible scenarios where our app could be used and result in a positive impact to somebody’s life.</p>
    <p>In this example, a college student has made a friend with an international student that speaks mostly French. He knows a few random words but wants to learn phrases he can use in conversation. Using an app he’s found, he is able to choose a category to learn and talk about with his friend.</p>

    <h2>Prototyping</h2>
    <img src="images/fraise/prototype.PNG">
    <p>We created prototypes to make our ideas physical and visualize interactions made within the apps. The first prototype was an idea proposed with the above storyboard that ultimately became fraise. The second was an french-teaching conversation bot app, but it was out of our scope and decided on the first. We wanted to keep the interface clean and easy to click through. With peer feedback, we improved the structure to be more clearly laid out and changed the topic names to better represent their content. Users weren't sure how to use the app in some cases so we decided to add a help button on ambiguous pages along with a more hierarchical design.</p>
    
    <h2>Wireframing</h2>
    <img src="images/fraise/wireframesog.PNG">
    <p>I was tasked with wireframing the application to demonstrate how the app would work. I iterated through several versions of different levels of fidelity until it became representative of the final product we had imagined. My teammates and I used these wireframes to develop the app from HTML/CSS and Javascript. As my teammates focused on the functionality of the app, I created and edited the stylistic aspects of the app throughout fraise's development. As the app progressed, we began altering the design by removing or adding functions and altering layout.</p>

    <h2>User Testing</h2> 
    <p>We implemented user testing in two separate ways. The first round of user testing consisted of individuals interacting with our app interface and us taking notes on what was easy for them to do and what was not as intuitive to those who had not created the app. At the end, we had them give us feedback on their experience which we used to better the app. Once these changes were implemented, we also performed AB testing in which we had two versions of our app randomly generated and used google analytics to track the frequency of clicks in both versions. The versions were different only on the profile page in which we decided to test whether having tabs or having a neat one page layout be more user friendly. This testing session revealed that there was no statistical difference, however sometimes users missed the second tab and thus we decided to implement the one-page version for the final project.</p>

    <h2>Final Product</h2>
    <img src="images/fraise/actualmock.png">
    <p>We cut out a few features that we weren't able to complete functionality for in the final. This included the ability to switch out phrases with automatic translation, ability to create new categories for favorited words, and a leveling system. Due of lack of capability and time, we decided to focus on our features of practices, quizzes, and favoriting. Achievements are earned when using these features and can be compared to friends'.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Throughout the process of creating this app, I realized how important user testing was for adjusting the flow of the app and meeting the needs of an actual user. I also have realized a growing passion for front-end development. Being the appointed designer, it was my job to provide the app with pleasing aesthetics and an easy to navigate layout. However, I wanted to go beyond just designing and help with the actual creation of the app itself. I was able to apply my designs through HTML/CSS. Although my skills are currently limited in that realm, I've decided to invest more into learning front-end development so I can better create what I design.</p>
